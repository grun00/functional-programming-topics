## Variables Names

In Elixir, a variable name always starts with a lowercase alphabetic character or an
underscore. After that, any combination of alphanumerics and underscores is allowed.
The prevalent convention is to use only lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and underscores:
* valid_variable_name
* also_valid_1
* validButNotRecommended
* NotValid

Variable names can also end with the question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!)
characters:
* valid_name?
* also_ok!
